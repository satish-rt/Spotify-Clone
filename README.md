# Spotify-Clone
Welcome to the Spotify Clone repository! This project is a front-end-only implementation of Spotify's core user interface, built purely using HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the visual design and layout of Spotify's web player, providing a responsive and interactive user experience without the use of JavaScript or backend functionality.
