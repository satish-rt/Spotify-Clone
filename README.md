Spotify Clone - HTML & CSS
Welcome to the Spotify Clone project! This is a front-end implementation of Spotify's web player interface, built entirely using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the visual design and layout of Spotify's user interface, focusing on responsive design and clean code without using JavaScript or backend functionality.

Features
Spotify-like UI: A visually accurate clone of Spotify's web player, including the sidebar, navigation, and music player.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Static Playlists: Display static playlists and song lists to mimic Spotify's library.

Music Player Interface: A static music player with play/pause, skip, and volume controls (non-functional, for design purposes only).

Dark Theme: A sleek, dark-themed design that matches Spotify's aesthetic.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content and layout.

CSS3: For styling, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.

No JavaScript: This project is intentionally built without JavaScript to focus on HTML and CSS skills.

No Backend: Static content only, no database or server-side functionality.
